//! sled-overlay is a small crate that serves as tooling to have intermediate
//! writes to some sled database. With it, we're able to write data into an
//! in-memory cache, and only flush to the actual sled trees after we decide
//! that everything in some batch was executed correctly.
//! This gives some minimal infrastructure to be able to transparently have
//! rollback-like functionality.
